# Coaching_Salary
### Project Overview
A given data set containing College School names, Coaches names, Coaches pay, and other information was given.  This information was used along with other information gathered from outside sources to predicting the salary of the next head coach of Syracuse University football.  The goal was to use linear regression to create a model based on the information gathered and answer lab questions regarding the next contract for the head coach of the football team.  Some of these questions were hypothetical with changes to the conference the team was in and some straightforward.  The best preforming predictors were identified, and some ethical decisions were made based on the project.  
### Data Cleaning
There were several issues that required attention in the data such as removing punctuation from numbers and making sure the actual pay was a numeric variable and not a string.  While public colleges are required to disclose the information about coachâ€™s salaries, in the research it was found that private colleges are not and when looking four of the private colleges did not disclose their coaching salaries.  These schools were removed from the data set.  There was information that was not used as predictors and removed from the data at this point.
